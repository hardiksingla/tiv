# The Indian Vidyarthi

## About this project
This Web Project was made by our team ([Hardik Singla](https://www.github.com/hardiksingla), [Hardik Bansal](https://www.github.com/HardikBansal206), [Samyak Jain](https://www.github.com/KayMas2808) and [Tarush Agarwal](https://www.github.com/tarush10000)) to test our frontend skills and make a simple modern website for The Indian Vidyarthi. <br>
We've primarily used HTML, Vanilla CSS and JS for the project. <br>
This project was made to create a link between TIV and their audience (the students) to quickly and easily share their newsletters, blogs and also to share info regarding the events they are conducting.
