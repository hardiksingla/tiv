            <h2>Non-Residential Indians or Never Returning Indians?</h2>
            <h5>Published on Aug 14, 2023</h5>
            <img src="../image/blog/Blog1_Image1.png" class="image">
            <p>One of the biggest barriers that Bharat has to break as it marches towards its aim 
                of becoming a developed nation by 2047 is 'BRAIN DRAIN'. You surely would have 
                heard or even have someone in your extended family who has gone abroad for 
                jobs. This is what is known as Brain Drain, the loss of a highly trained and skilled 
                population due to emigration to other countries.</p>
            <p>Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, Indira Nooyi - all these big names that we have
                heard of are the perfect examples proving the Indian Brain Drain. All of them were 
                born in India, gained a major part of their education from India, and left India for 
                better job opportunities and quality higher education.</p>
            <h5>THE PROBLEM</h5>
            <p>Data suggest that about 9 lakh Indian nationals have given up their Indian 
                citizenship since 2015 and 23000 millionaires have given up their Indian 
                citizenship since 2014. In today's scenario, every financially stable Indian 
                Household aspires to send their children, to study abroad, to work abroad. Now 
                the term NRI has changed from 'Non-residential Indians' to 'Never-returning 
                Indians'. But the question is what is the cause of this problem? There are many 
                answers to this question. The first reason is - Better Higher Education- In India, the 
                share of the government's expenditure on Higher Education is very minimal and 
                the main concentration of expenditure is only on elementary education. Secondly, 
                there is a lack of economic opportunities and the Indian economy is unable to 
                produce sufficient high-paying jobs for its skilled population. The quality of life in 
                other developed countries is quite better than that in India. Also, there is a lack of 
                research infrastructure.</p>

            <h5>SOLUTIONS</h5>
            <p>Now, coming to the solutions to these problems and the necessary government 
                steps to transform this brain drain into brain gain. First of all, the government will 
                have to divert its expenditure towards tertiary education and set up quality higher 
                education institutions like IITs, NLUs, and IIMs. The government would also have 
                to make sure that the main aim of these courses is gaining skills that are 
                important to avail high-paying skilled jobs. The government will also have to 
                create more job opportunities in the professional sector â€“ doctors, engineers, etc. 
                Apart from this, the government will have to focus on improving the quality of life 
                in the country. The Overseas Citizenship of India which is being provided by the 
                government to the People of Indian origin is an important policy towards 
                transforming brain drain into brain gain as more and more Indian-Origin people 
                will be re-availing of their Indian citizenship.</p>
            <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
            <p>In a nutshell, this problem of Brain Drain is like a termite to the Indian Economic 
                development and as India marches towards its 100 years of independence, it will 
                have to make sure that it is able to retain its skilled workforce and employ them in 
                the country itself to make Bharat a developed economy.
