            <h2>Ableism</h2>
            <h5>Published on Aug 16, 2023</h5>
            <img src="../image/blog/Blog4_Image1.png" class="image">
            <h4>What is ableism?</h4>
            <p>Ableism in simple words can be defined as discrimination against a person with disabilities. The discrimination may be intentional or unintentional and is based on the idea that non-disabled people are superior to disabled ones. It’s all based on the notion that disabled people are weaker, imperfect and need fixing without realising the fact that none of us is perfect and that we all need fixing in our ways.</p>
            <h4>Unintentional use of ableist language</h4>
            <p>If we look at the language we use daily it might be shocking to many that we unintentionally use ableist language. This isn’t your fault as the words regarding disabilities are considered negative and many times we use them to defame the other person as well as you’ve never been educated about such things but now is the time.</p>
            <h4>Types of Ableist remarks</h4>
            <p>First of all, we all must know that there are two types of ableist remarks -: one based on physical disabilities and the other based on neurodivergence.</p>
            <h4>Commonly used ableist words and phrases(Is ableist language inherent?)</h4>
            <p>We all use these words without knowing what they literally mean and it is very common amongst people to use such words and phrases, let’s start with the most common one</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Dumb- We’ve all called someone or the other dumb at some point in our life. We use “dumb” to make a person feel that he ain’t intelligent but dumb refers to a person who is unable to communicate efficiently in a verbal manner.</li>
              <li>Lame- We often refer to PJs(poor jokes) as “lame” sometimes which we use to tell that it is dull or boring but “lame” actually refers to someone’s lower body parts(legs) which aren’t functioning properly for that person to walk.</li>
              <li>Spastic- We sometimes use the word “spastic” for someone who creates chaos and all but the term “spastic” actually refers to muscle contractions.</li>
              <li>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder(OCD)- We regularly use the term OCD very liberally like ‘he’s such an OCD about cleaning” or so, through which people express that they’re obsessed with something like hygiene. When we use this word so liberally without knowing what it means we’re undermining the experiences of the people suffering from mental health.</li>
              <li>These were some of the most common ones whereas we also use phrases like ‘turned a blind eye’;’ fell on deaf years’; ‘crazy’; ‘psychotic’ or ‘insane’. All these words have one thing in common that many might not know is that all these words mock people with physical or mental disabilities, still, we use them in our daily lives undermining their struggle by negatively portraying them.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Be it any language the ableism is inherent in them just like patriarchy
              If we talk about India specifically India, Hindi is one of the most spoken languages and it is also ableist, we use ableist words daily in Hindi too.
              For ex- Lets recall have you ever called anyone “Pagal(mad)”,                              ”mental”, ”Andha(blind)”, “behra(deaf)” or one of the most common phrases “andho m kaana raja (a one-eyed king amongst the blind)”? Yes, most of us have without realising that we’re mocking the unfortunate people.
            </p>
            <p>The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (“RPD Act”) was enacted with due cognisance of the obligations under the United National Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), to which India is a signatory. </p>
            <p>Even after 4 years of this act ableism continues to be normalised everywhere starting from a school where we create a social construct of marginalising disabled people and creating different schools for them which imbibes that “they’re different” within us. According to the World Health Organisation(WHO), about 15% of the world’s population or around 1 billion people are disabled making them the largest minority group.</p>
            <p>According to UNESCO, Ninety per cent of children with disabilities in developing countries do not attend school.</p>
            <p>Even though persons with disabilities constitute a significant 5 to 6 per cent of India’s population, their employment needs remain unmet, says a study by India’s National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People, despite the “People with Disabilities” Act, which reserves for them 3 per cent of government jobs. Of some 70 million persons with disabilities in India, only about 100,000 have succeeded in obtaining employment in the industry.</p>
