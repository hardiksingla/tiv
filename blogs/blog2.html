            <h2> Should we really be Happy?</h2>
            <h5>Published on Aug 14, 2023</h5>
            <img src="../image/blog/Blog2_Image1.png" class="image">
            <p>India has crossed United Kingdom and has become the fifth largest economy in terms of GDP. This is a 
                indeed a huge milestone but netizens, before aggrandizing the milestone let us do a reality check! 
                So, if you are aware: GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product. It means the total amount of services and 
                goods produced within the boundaries of the country. But have we ever noticed how many stomachs we 
                need to feed from the same profits? </p>
            <p>India's population is twenty times more than that of England. So, England is like a small prosperous 
                village but we are like the jam-packed slums surviving on the same produce. 
                India's GDP has grown, no doubt. But there is little doubt that India's population has grown too 
                aggravating the problem. </p>
            <p>If we compare the per capita income of the nations then India is still struggling. India is still at 144th 
                position of the 194 economies. India's unbridled population explosion hasn't let us reach the expected 
                pinnacles of glory. Sadly, the situation is still grim in this respect as we will soon surpass China in the 
                coming years. </p>
            <p>Back in the 1900s when realization dawned upon Chinese leaders that population will hamper their 
                growth, they implemented the stringent one-child policy. It is quite important to point out that China is 
                roughly three times larger than India but we sit very close to each other when it comes to population 
                figures. </p>
            <p>Back then, their government took serious actions to curb the growing population, then think about what 
                will become of us. Till now, there is no concrete action task of the government to tackle the issue. 
                Sometimes the leaders promise to take action but it seems that the action hides behind the mere words 
                of tall promises. </p>
            <p>The increasing divide between rich and poor is a grave concern too. The rich is becoming richer but there 
                is not much elevation in the conditions of poor people compared to the GDP numbers. 
                On a brighter note, India is the current largest growing economy in the world. But as citizens of India, if 
                we could remove this two common hedge growths in our path, then we will reach our destination of 
                success early. </p>
            <p>This article is intended to make people see and realize what lies beneath the tip of the iceberg. This will 
                help all of us to strive harder for excellence and bring new vigor in the road of economic development 
                instead of blowing the trumpet.
