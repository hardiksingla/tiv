            <h2>Busting The Aryan Invasion Theory</h2>
            <h5>Published on Aug 14, 2023</h5>
            <img src="../image/blog/Blog3_Image1.png" class="image">
            <p>We all have studied the Aryan invasion theory in our school N.C.E.R.T. textbooks ? What it mentioned is- the indigenous people of India, who lived in the north-west (current day Pakistan) or the so-called Indus valley and Harappan civilisation. It also described indigenous people as dark-skinned ‘Dravidians’ who built the civilisation, and that Sanskrit-speaking, Vedic-Hinduism-practicing, light-skinned ‘Aryan’ invaders from the Central Asian steppe came in afterward. They destroyed the native civilization, subjugated them, imposed Hinduism and caste system and ultimately forced them to migrate to the south of the peninsula.</p>
            <p>Now what if this whole theory is false and man-made. Let's hold on and study another theory called the ‘Out of India theory’, its crux is that there was no Dravidian civilization but a vedic civilization which is the base of current Indian culture and people and it still continues in Bharat. The proponents of this theory cite archaeological evidence of civilizational and cultural continuity, which are also supported by some Indian literary sources such as the Puranas, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana – (which some may consider as mythologies.)</p>
            <p>There are a lot of current customs and traditions which have been continued for thousands of years such as- Statues found at the site of Naushero, located 6 km away from Mehrgarh, indicate that women used to apply sindoor on their forehead thousands of years back too. This new theory states that there was a large-scale westward migration of Indians from these civilisations to the Middle-East and Europe. This can easily be proved by 1) Falsifying the AIT, 2) Proving the OOI theory with proves.</p>
            <p>So let's get the Aryan Invasion/Migration in a simple way. What changes are seen when a large-scale invasion/migration occurs in a region ? Firstly, there are genetic changes in the population over a period of time as people with some new inferior genes reproduce with the natives and it mixes the genes. Secondly, there are cultural and archeological changes in the society. An example of this is the Coorg region of Karnataka, the people living in Coorg are believed to be of Greek or Turkic descent because of their dressing style, fighting technique, their sword and more. It means that these changes should have occurred in the Indus Valley civilization too, but neither there was genetic mixing nor civilisational changes took place. Now scientific inquiry is the only way forward- </p>
            <p>The Sarasvati river is extensively mentioned in the Rig Veda- India’s foundational literary text. This river is referred to as “greatest of rivers”, “loudly roaring”, and “mother of floods”. These depictions clearly refer to a mighty river, and this falsifies the Aryan Invasion Theory. According to AIT, Rig Veda was composed after a purported Aryan invasion/migration that happened at around 1,500 BCE but the text in Rig Veda when compared to scientific studies, indicates that it was composed closer to 5,000 BCE when the river was last in its prime form and then started to decline. It also obviously indicates that Sanskrit was the native language of Indians from a long time ago and was not brought up by the Aryans. 
              Research not only rejects the possibility of an ‘Aryan invasion/migration’ but also proves the ‘Out of India’ or the westward migration of Indians. Genetic Research demonstrates the absence of any significant outside genetic influence in India for the past 10,000 – 15,000 years. It concludes that Indian populations are genetically unique and harbor the second highest genetic diversity after Africans.</p>
            <p>A haplogroup is a large, extended family or clan, all of whose members have a shared ancestry. R1a1 haplogroup (descended from father to son) is closely associated with the spread of Indo-European languages across Eurasia. In India, R1a1 is identified as the haplogroup that represents the Indo-Aryan people. Research shows that this haplogroup originated in India, the oldest examples of the haplogroup R1a are found in the Indian subcontinent and are approximately 15,450 years old. This is irrefutable scientific proof that Indians expanded out of India and settled lands far to the west in Europe. Which theory do you believe in? I believe that the government and other institutions should ponder more on such important aspects of our history- our origin- our existence and discard other man-made theories from society.</p>
            <p>I have just listed out a pair or two of evidence that bust this theory but you should research this yourself and read out some articles.</p>
